These are scripts which only apply if you are still using the foundation-provided demo dataset and want to upgrade it instead of rebuilding from the base dataset.  (Which will contain these changes.)

The main "build" script is a combination SQL / Aqua Data Studio command file which builds SQL files to run into your database.
