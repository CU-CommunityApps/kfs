/**
 * This class encapsulates the information needed by the generic routing 
 * framework. The routing attributes that a particular piece
 * of routing data can be used by are listed as elements of a String 
 * array: routingTypes. This array has an additional element that
 * is populated with a Guid. This is just to prevent XStream from creating 
 * a reference if two RoutingData objects have identical
 * routingTypes data.  Each RoutingTypes element is the simple name of the 
 * class of the routing attribute that will use the routingSet information of
 * the RoutingData object to calculate routing.
 * 
 * The resulting XML is generally more readable if each RoutingData object
 * has a unique RoutingTypes and the RoutingSet contains multiple RoutingObjects.
