            The Transfer of Funds (TF) document is used to transfer funds (cash) between accounts. There are two kinds of transfer transactions: mandatory and non-mandatory.

            Mandatory transfers are required to meet contractual agreements. Specific object codes are used to identify these transactoins. An example is moving dedicated student fees and retirement of indebtedness fund group for principal and interest payments on bonds.

            Non-mandatory transfers are allocation of unrestricted cash between fund groups which are not required either by the terms of a loan or by other external agreements. These transfers are the most commonly used through most institutions.
