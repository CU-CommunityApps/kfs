/**
 * The Transfer of Funds (TF) document is used to transfer funds (cash) between accounts. There are two kinds of transfer
 * transactions, mandatory and non-mandatory. Mandatory transfers are required to meet contractual agreements. Specific object codes
 * are used to identify these transactions. Examples of these are: moving dedicated student fees to the retirement of indebtedness
 * fund group for principal and interest payments on bonds. Non-mandatory transfers are allocations of unrestricted cash between
 * fund groups which are not required either by the terms of a loan or by other external agreements. These transfers are the most
 * commonly used throughout the university.
