 * This is the business object that represents the <code>{@link YearEndDocument}</code> version of

 * are the source lines, to lines are the target lines. This document is exactly the same as the non-<code>{@link YearEndDocument}</code>
 * version except that it has slightly different routing and that it only allows posting to the year end accounting period for a
 * year.
