/**
 * This interface defines the methods that a PermissionService must provide. PermissionService implements methods used to support
 * the BudgetConstruction Security Model. The User access mode to a Budgeted Account (BC Document) is calculated based on the
 * current level of the document in it's organization hierarchy and the set of organizations where the user is defined as a BC
 * Document approver in the organization review hierarchy or the set of accounts where the user is defined as the Fiscal Officer.
 * Edit access requires the document to be at the same level as one of the user's organization approval nodes or the user is a
 * fiscal officer or delegate of an account for a document at level zero. the User gets View access to a document set at a level
 * below a user's organization approval node. No access is allowed to a document set at a level above the user's organization
 * approval node. Organization review hierarchy approval nodes are defined in Workflow as rules using the KualiOrgReviewTemplate
 * where the Document Type is KualiBudgetConstructionDocument and the Chart and Organization codes define the node in the hierarchy
 * and responsibilty type is Person or Workgroup and Action Request Code is Approve. TODO verify the description of the rule
 * definition after implementation.
