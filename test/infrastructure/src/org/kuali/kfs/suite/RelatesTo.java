/**
 * This annotation marks test classes or methods which have failed for reasons relating to certain JIRA issues. Ideally these issues
 * would be about bugs in production code or database tasks, but they could be about test code too.
 * <p>
 * One purpose of this annotation is to remove the related tests from the Anthill results while their issues are in progress. This
 * prevents them from obscuring new test failures that need attention, by allowing the Anthill results to be maintained at 100%
 * success.
 * <p>
 * Another purpose of this annotation is for KualiTestBase to wrap any test errors or failures with a notice that the annotated JIRA
 * issues are related. If the {@value #SKIP_OPEN_OR_IN_PROGRESS_OR_REOPENED_JIRA_ISSUES} system property is set, then the test will
 * pass (without running its contents) any test that {@link RelatesTo} a JIRA issue that is currently open or in-progress or
 * reopened. This is an alternative to {@link org.kuali.kfs.suite.OpenOrInProgressOrReopenedSuite} for Anthill to retain the same
 * format of its test report while not revealing any failures of such tests. When using this system property, keep in mind that it
 * takes well over a minute to get the list of open issues from JIRA. The list is cached statically, so it's insignificant to add a
 * minute or two to the time it takes for the whole Anthill build. But, developers will probably not want to add this system
 * property to their own environments, because of this delay and so that they can still work on those tests.
