/**
 * This annotation marks test classes or methods which have failed for reasons relating to certain JIRA issues.
 * Ideally these issues would be about bugs in production code or database tasks, but they could be about test code too.
 * <p>
 * One purpose of this annotation is to remove the related tests from the Anthill results while their issues are in progress.
 * This prevents them from obscuring new test failures that need attention, by allowing the Anthill results to be maintained at 100% success.
 * <p>
 * Another purpose of this annotation is for KualiTestBase to wrap any test errors or failures with a notice
 * that the annotated JIRA issues are related.
