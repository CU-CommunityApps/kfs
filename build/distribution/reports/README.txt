Reporting was not considered in scope of the Kuali Financial System Project.
The reports in this directory are the "FIS Standard Reports", the core reports used by the system managers of the system on which KFS was based.
We've included these reports in the distribution, so that if you have an SQR license, you can use them.  If not, you can use them for reference when creating your own reports.
